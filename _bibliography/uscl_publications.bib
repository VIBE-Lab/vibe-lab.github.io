abstract = {With the rise in clinicopathologic prognosis and the introduction of whole slide imaging scanners, artificial intelligence systems are being suggested to assist pathologists in their decision-making processes. Despite advancements, the variability in digital pathology images, due to different organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes, poses significant challenges. This variability, known as domain shift, affects the performance of machine learning models trained on specific datasets. Addressing these challenges, this paper explores domain generalization (DG) in semantic segmentation for digital histopathology images. We systematically evaluate the DG capabilities of six prominent deep learning models across two novel adenocarcinoma segmentation datasets. Our comparative analysis provides insights into the models’ effectiveness in mitigating domain shift, contributing to the advancement of DG in computational pathology.},

  abstract={Digital pathology diagnosis systems face significant domain shift problems that hinder their performance on new datasets. Existing methods for aligning digital pathology images from different domains mainly focus on stain color and overlook the potential domain shifts caused by variations in image quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel parametric model that incorporates both stain color and image quality constraints for domain adaptation of digital pathology images. We evaluate our approach on the domain adaptive mitosis detection task through extensive experiments and ablation studies, showing that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {The density of mitotic figures (MF) within tumor tissue is known to be highly correlated with tumor proliferation and thus is an important marker in tumor grading. Recognition of MF by pathologists is subject to a strong inter-rater bias, limiting its prognostic value. State-of-the-art deep learning methods can support experts but have been observed to strongly deteriorate when applied in a different clinical environment. The variability caused by using different whole slide scanners has been identified as one decisive component in the underlying domain shift. The goal of the MICCAI MIDOG 2021 challenge was the creation of scanner-agnostic MF detection algorithms. The challenge used a training set of 200 cases, split across four scanning systems. As test set, an additional 100 cases split across four scanning systems, including two previously unseen scanners, were provided. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the approaches that were submitted to the challenge and identify methodological factors contributing to better performance. The winning algorithm yielded an F1 score of 0.748 (CI95: 0.704-0.781), exceeding the performance of six experts on the same task.}
