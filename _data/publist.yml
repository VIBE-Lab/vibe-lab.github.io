  description: "The field of digital pathology has made significant strides in tumor diagnosis and segmentation, driven by various challenges. Despite these advancements, the efficacy of current algorithms encounters a significant challenge due to the inherent diversity present in digital pathology images and tissues. The variances arise from diverse organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes, resulting in what is termed as domain-shift. The primary goal of COSAS is to develop strategies that enhance the resilience of computer-aided semantic segmentation solutions against domain-shift, ensuring consistent performance across different organs and scanners. This challenge seeks to advance the development of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for routine diagnostic use in laboratories. Notably, COSAS marks the first challenge in computational histopathology, providing a platform for evaluating domain adaptation methods on a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse organs and scanners from various manufacturers."

# - title: "Security Allocation in Networked Control Systems"
#   image: Tung_Lic_2023.jpg
#   description: This thesis develops a framework for evaluating and improving the security of networked control systems in the face of cyber attacks. The considered security problem involves two strategic agents, namely a malicious adversary and a defender, pursuing their specific and conflicting goals. The defender aims to efficiently allocate defense resources with the purpose of detecting malicious activities. Meanwhile, the malicious adversary simultaneously conducts cyber attacks and remains stealthy to the defender. We tackle the security problem by proposing a game-theoretic framework and characterizing its main components the payoff function, the action space, and the available information for each agent. Especially, the payoff function is characterized based on the output-to-output gain security metric that fully explores the worst-case attack impact. Then, we investigate the properties of the game and how to efficiently compute its equilibrium. Given the combinatorial nature of the defender actions, one important challenge is to alleviate the computational burden. To overcome this challenge, the thesis contributes several system- and graph-theoretic conditions that enable the defender to shrink the action space, efficiently allocating the defense resources. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through numerical examples.

# - title: "Safety, Security and Privacy for Cyber-Physical Systems"
#   image: Springer_book_2021.png
#   description: This book presents an in-depth overview of recent work related to the safety, security, and privacy of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). It brings together contributions from leading researchers in networked control systems and closely related fields to discuss overarching aspects of safety, security, and privacy; characterization of attacks; and solutions to detecting and mitigating such attacks.<br/>The book begins by providing an insightful taxonomy of problems, challenges and techniques related to safety, security, and privacy for CPSs. It then moves through a thorough discussion of various control-based solutions to these challenges, including cooperative fault-tolerant and resilient control and estimation, detection of attacks and security metrics, watermarking and encrypted control, privacy and a novel defense approach based on deception. The book concludes by discussing risk management and cyber-insurance challenges in CPSs, and by presenting the future outlook for this area of research as a whole.<br/>Its wide-ranging collection of varied works in the emerging fields of security and privacy in networked control systems makes this book a benefit to both academic researchers and advanced practitioners interested in implementing diverse applications in the fields of IoT, cooperative autonomous vehicles and the smart cities of the future.
